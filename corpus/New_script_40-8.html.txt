[Triad HQ auditorium]

MEL: Doctor! 
DOCTOR: All of you... everyone, get out! All of you, get out! 
SUTEKH-SUSAN: I bring Sutekh's dust of death. 
DOCTOR: Get out! Go! 
MEL: Come on, we've got to go! 
(Susan blows sand from her hand. It reaches two people who promptly dessicate to nothing.) 
MEL: Go! Come on, let's go!

[Triad HQ car park]

(Mel takes a spare helmet from her orange Vespa scooter's under-seat storage space.) 
MEL: Hop on, cowboy.

[UNIT HQ]

DOCTOR [OC]: Kate, this is the Doctor. We're on our way back. Try to contain that thing. 
SUTEKH-HARRIET: I bring Sutekh's dust of death. 
KATE: Open fire! All weapons! 
(All they do is make marks on the Tardis.) 

[Time window vault]

RUBY: Why can't I see her?

[UNIT HQ]

IBRAHIM: All the bullets turn to dust, ma'am. 
KATE: Oh, one day! 
SUTEKH-HARRIET: I bring Sutekh's dust of death. 
(Blows the dust around. The Vlinx goes bang.)

[Streets of London]

KATE [OC]: Doctor, are you there? This is me signing off... with thanks and love. And please send this monster back into hell. 
DOCTOR: No! 
KATE [OC]: Because I have to hope that the birds will sing again. There will be birds. 
(UNIT HQ fills with the dust of death.) 
MEL: There's nothing we can do... except fight! 
(She rides off, with the Doctor on the pillion-seat.) 
DOCTOR: Faster, Mel, faster! 
MEL: I'm going as fast as I can! 
DOCTOR: No, I mean, faster! 
(A tidal wave of dust is rolling through the streets.) 
MAN ON BUS: Open the door! Open the door! 
DOCTOR: Mel, go right! 
(A taxi driver crashes as Mel just avoids the edge of the dust cloud.)

[Ruby's home]

RADIO: We interrupt this broadcast with warnings of an incident in Central London. People are being told to evacuate the city immediately. 
(Mrs Flood looks at the approaching dust storm.)

[Taxi]

CARLA: What is it? What's going on?

[Ruby's home]

FLOOD: Do you believe in the power of prayer? 
CHERRY: I most certainly do. 
FLOOD: Then tell your maker I will come to storm down his gates of gold and seize his kingdom in my true name. 
CHERRY: Wh... whatcha talkin' about? Who... who are you? 
(Mrs Flood puts her arm around Cherry.) 
FLOOD: I'm sorry, you tiny little woman. I'm so, so sorry it ends like this. I had such plans... 
(They crumble to dust. So does Carla in the taxi.)

[Time window vault]

(The image of the Tardis groans.) 
COMPUTER: Time membrane failing. 
DOCTOR: You, get out. Bunker 17, now. 
RUBY: Doctor! My mother, why can't we see her? 
DOCTOR: Ruby, we have got worse problems. 
(He goes into that Tardis, looks around, smiles and comes out again. He sonicks the TV screen showing the recording on the VHS tape and picks it up.) 
DOCTOR: It's a Tardis remembered. It's made of memories. Ruby, it is feeding off you, yeah? Give it everything you've got, babes. Remember it harder. 
RUBY: Yes. Yes. Yes, I can. Yes. 
DOCTOR: If Time is a memory, then memory is a time machine. Yes! Yes, that's it. More. More, more, more! 
(Ding!) 
DOCTOR: That should do it. Okay. Right. The Tardis is remembering itself. 
MEL: Doctor. 
(Sutekh, the original Tardis and Harriet arrive.) 
SUTEKH: We meet again, my old friend. 
DOCTOR: Don't you dare. 
RUBY: Doctor, what is that thing? 
DOCTOR: Sutekh, The Death of Ages. The Typhonian Beast. The greatest monster I have ever fought. 
SARAH [Pyramids of Mars]: If Sutekh is so totally evil, why didn't Horus and the other Osirans destroy him? 
DOCTOR: The Time window has my memories, too. 
DOCTOR 4 [on screen]: It's against their code. To have killed him would have meant that they were no better than he. 
MEL: It's your life, Doctor. 
DOCTOR 4 [on screen]: So they simply imprisoned him. 
MEL: It's telling the story of your life. 
DOCTOR: A long time ago, in the England of 1911, Sutekh had been bound and imprisoned for all eternity, but he rose again and I defeated him. 
I cast you into the Time Vortex. I sent you forward to your own death! 
SUTEKH: Instead, I found a home. I clung to your infernal machine. And for so many years I hid. I have travelled with you for all this time, 
riding the spine of your ship, staring into eternity and evolving into my true godhood. Now I know every beat of the heart of your time machine, 
and I can bend it to my will. 
(Harriet operates the real console.) 
SUTEKH: It will stand as my altar, the temple of my Empire of Death. Never yours again, Doctor. Never. And I saw, inside the Tardis, so many secrets. 
Her name. 
DOCTOR: Susan. 
SUTEKH: The perfect trap. I created an apparition of her universally. Every time we landed, on every single world, I birthed them all, my angels of death, 
now standing triumphant across the universe. 
VARIOUS SUSANS: I bring Sutekh's... dust of... death. 
SUTEKH: Every living thing is an abomination. I am come to release them into blessed death, and I find that good. 
DOCTOR: Then I damn you, Sutekh. I damn you in the name of life itself! And I swear to you, with both the hearts of the last of the Time Lords, 
I will stop you. I will defeat you. And I will turn back death. And why... am I still alive? Killing me is your gift. And believe me, Sutekh, 
I'm an extinction event. So what is stopping you? Why is the God of Death not killing me? What am I missing? I'll tell you a secret, Sutes. 
This feeling that you have now... this doubt... have you ever felt so alive? And doesn't it feel good? Run!

[Memory Tardis]

(See the various Tales of the Tardis for a better explanation.) 
RUBY: What is it? 
DOCTOR: It's a remembered Tardis. It's bits and pieces of every Tardis that ever was, held together by hopes and wishes and luck. 
(Mel finds the 6th Doctor's spotted tie and coat of many colours.) 
RUBY: Wait. Does this thing work? Can it fly? 
DOCTOR: No idea. 
(The Tardis zooms out into space. Sparks fly, the TV screen goes bang. Things fall out of roundels and break.) 
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. We need that. Whoa! Right. Ruby Roo! Ruby Roo! Tie that to that. Yeah? 
RUBY: Right. 
MEL: Oh! 
DOCTOR: Mel! Mel. 
MEL: What? 
DOCTOR: Tie that lever down. All those switches, down, down, down, down, down. Yeah? And Ruby, you see these wires? Tie them together, and tie them tight. 
MEL: Doctor! We're on fire! 
(The Doctor uses a fire extinguisher.) 
MEL: Is this thing safe? 
DOCTOR: Absolute deathtrap, Melanie B. Okay... Yep, that's better. 
(Laces bits together with a bungee cord.) 
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, that's it. That's it. Calm down. That's it. Nice and easy. Okay. You see? That hook is a molecular bond. It's like intelligent rope. 
RUBY: What, you mean like...? 
DOCTOR: The intelligent glove. That was the first day we met. Oh man, I am... so sorry. We've got to stabilise. Cos without the Time window's memories,
we go kaboom. That screen is holding the Tardis together. 
RUBY: Okay, so what did I miss? Every Susan Triad, they were innocent? They were all real? 
DOCTOR: Absolutely real. Every time the Tardis would land, it would roll her out like... Okay, so the Tardis has a perception filter so it doesn't get noticed, 
it just sits there, kind of unseen, 'cos it casts a field around it at 66.7 metres exactly. 
RUBY: 73 yards. 
DOCTOR: How do you know that? 
RUBY: I... I don't know. I just do. 
DOCTOR: Funny things happen at 73 yards. People say that you can see things. So... Sutekh, he used this field, but used it massively. 
He focused his mind, created a whole new person everywhere I'd land. But perception means that she fitted in. She had a character, she had a 
history, she had a truth. 
MEL: But, Doctor, you've landed on Earth a hundred times. 
DOCTOR: I think she was reborn every time. Each time the Tardis would land, the idea of that woman would get stronger and stronger. 
By 2024, she was Susan Triad, this monumental figure. 
RUBY: What's she done? Sutekh called her an angel of death. What did she do? 
(The Doctor opens the Tardis doors. The dust storm has encircled the Earth as far as the east coast of Australia.) 
DOCTOR: The dust of death... spreading all over the world. 
RUBY: My mother, is she...? 
DOCTOR: It's everyone. 
RUBY: No, but can't you just...? 
DOCTOR: Nothing I can do. 
RUBY: She was... 
DOCTOR: It's happening over and over again. Every time I landed there. 1999. 1066. 2005. The Earth is dying... so many times. 
(He goes back inside and closes the doors.) 
DOCTOR: Every world that I ever stood upon... all dead. Venus. Telos. Karn. The Ood Sphere. And Skaro. 
MEL: The Daleks are dead? 
DOCTOR: Everything is dead. 
MEL: But there's so many places you haven't been. They must be safe. 
DOCTOR: I've travelled so far. Everything caught in that pattern is dying. The whole of Time and Space. I did this. 
RUBY: You did not. 
MEL: No. 
(He opens the doors again.) 
DOCTOR: Every sun is dead. The universe has come to a halt. And it is my fault, 'cos I travelled to all those worlds. I thought it was fun. 
(The Doctor screams into the void.)

[UNIT HQ]

SUTEKH: The universe stands silent, in death. Yet one thing persists. One thing keeps living, despite me. 
SUSAN: The Time Lord. 
SUTEKH: No. Greater than him. A secret the Child carries with her. But I will find them. Out there, in the hollows of this desolate universe, 
they are hiding, somewhere, lost in the wind and the wilds.

[Tent]

(On a desolate planet, a makeshift marquee-type tent.) 
DOCTOR: Excuse me. Can you tell me... where are we? 
WOMAN: No idea. Absolutely no idea, darling. All I've got is this chaffee. Do you want some? 
DOCTOR: That's very kind. Only if you have enough. 
WOMAN: Where did you come from? 
DOCTOR: Nowhere. Er... I... got a bit lost. It's been a very, very long time. 
WOMAN: I haven't seen anyone in weeks. There was a caravan that passed through, heading towards... I don't know, somewhere over that way. 
They said there was food, but I haven't seen them since. Hush now, darling. Let me give the man his chaffee. 
(There is a baby in a wicker bassinette hidden by a fabric hood.) 
DOCTOR: Who is the little one? 
WOMAN: I think I called her Brindle. Brindle Dee. But I forget. 
DOCTOR: What is this place called? 
WOMAN: Hard to remember. I... They say memory is dying. There was a man that said that actual facts are dying in the death wave. But I think
this was the city of... It began with a B. 
DOCTOR: And the planet? 
WOMAN: I don't think I was born here. Then I met my husband, whatever his name was. Tall. He was tall. I remember that. But it was all a very long time ago. 
DOCTOR: Well, at least you survived. 
WOMAN: I'm not sure I did, really. The funny thing is, I do remember an opera house, over that way. Of all the things to remember. Maybe I worked there. 
Maybe I sang. But people used to come from all over, with lights and their diamonds and all sorts of things. It was lovely. 
DOCTOR: Have you got any metal? 
WOMAN: Metal is a precious thing, sir. 
DOCTOR: I don't think anything's precious any more. 
WOMAN: I suppose you do have a very nice face. 
(She unwraps a spoon and hands it to him.) 
WOMAN: I'll forget it in a minute. 
DOCTOR: That's very kind of you. I will use this spoon, I promise. I might save the universe with this spoon. 
WOMAN: That would be nice. You should go now. 
DOCTOR: Are you... are you okay? 
WOMAN: I think my daughter died, didn't she? And I forgot. 
DOCTOR: I think she did. I'm sorry. 
WOMAN: They say it travels, the death wave, down the family line. Except that this man, he said it's... it's... It's perverse, that's what he said. 
That it's so determined to kill that it can travel backwards, from child to mother. But that's okay, because I really am very tired. 
You've got such a nice face. 
(She turns to dust.) 
DOCTOR: I swear to you... with a spoon.

[Memory Tardis]
 
DOCTOR: That's what we need, just some metal. Not a Tardis memory, something real. Thank you, whoever you were. Look. Look. Look. After all this time, 
it's still connected to the Time window. 
(Scene from Pyramids of Mars, where Sutekh is sent into the Vortex. Mel is cuddling the 7th Doctor's jumper.) 
RUBY: Yeah, I never understood. What was all that Egyptian stuff? 
DOCTOR: Cultural appropriation. 
RUBY: Oh. And who were they? That woman and the man with the hair? 
DOCTOR: They just... travelled in the Tardis. That's how I know Mel. We travelled together, didn't we? 
MEL: Best time of my life. 
DOCTOR: We met Einstein. 
MEL: Did we? God, I'd forgotten. 
DOCTOR: Are you okay? 
MEL: Exhausted. 
RUBY: But I still don't get it. What changed? Sutekh was hidden for years. Why did he go on the attack? 
DOCTOR: Ask that again. 
RUBY: Why did he go on the attack? Why did Sutekh appear on Ruby Road? 
(Image changes to the CCTV.) 
DOCTOR: It's answering you. The images are reaching out to you. 
RUBY: What do you mean? 
DOCTOR: They're trying to help. 
(The woman-with-no-face turns and points.) 
DOCTOR: The Time window is still connected to your memories. Maybe it's trying to ask you something. 
RUBY: But what does this have to do with my mother? 
DOCTOR: Oh, because... because... Oh! Oh, Sutekh became visible outside the church, because when he landed with the Tardis in 2004, 
he saw the one thing beyond his comprehension. Your mother. 
RUBY: But who is she? 
DOCTOR: We don't know, and neither does he. That's the point. She drives us crazy, but Sutekh...? Oh. He's been riding on the back 
of the Tardis, beholding all of Time and Space, and then he can't see one woman. One woman! One singular, mysterious woman. 
No wonder he's keeping us alive, to figure out the answer. Who is she? 
RUBY: But if gods are scared of her, what the hell does that mean? She's not this big cosmic thing, is she? Because in that case, what am I? 
DOCTOR: Ruby, you are absolutely human. 
RUBY: But who is she? And why was she pointing at you? 
DOCTOR: Hey, hey. Come here. 
SUTEKH [OC]: Melanie. Melanie. I see you.

[UNIT HQ]

SUTEKH-SUSAN: We can find the living through Time and Space... and family.

[Memory Tardis]

RUBY: I wish there was something we could do to just see her. 
(The screen goes to 2046 and Amol Rajan interviewing Roger ap Gwilliam.) 
AMOL [on screen]: But the government says... 
RUBY: Okay, who's that? 
ROGER [on screen]: I mean, the government has collapsed in shame. In absolute shame. 
DOCTOR: Let me see. 
ROGER [on screen]: Now's the time to vote. 
(But when the Doctor takes the screen it goes blank.) 
DOCTOR: No, nothing. 
RUBY: Give it to me. There! I mean, him. 
DOCTOR: Er... Show me. 
AMOL [on screen]: ..your manifesto, in particular, the DNA testing regime. 
DOCTOR: It's giving you another answer. But what is it? 
AMOL [on screen]: ..infringing human rights? 
RUBY: Well that's that guy off the TV, but who's he? 
ROGER [on screen]: I propose compulsory DNA testing for the entire population. We... 
DOCTOR: Roger ap Gwilliam. The most dangerous Prime Minister in history. 
ROGER [on screen]: ..for crime or... 
DOCTOR: But that's 2046. You haven't met him, have you? 
RUBY: No. No, I couldn't, could I? 
DOCTOR: Then why is it showing you...? 2046, 2046. 2046. 2046! He did it! DNA testing became compulsory for the entire population in the UK. 
So if your mother was still alive... 
RUBY: She'd be on record. 
DOCTOR: She would be on the register. We've never been able to find her because she never got tested. But 2046, she's got no choice. 
It is showing us the way, Ruby! It's showing us a path to your mother. If I can just... 
MEL: What does that mean? Can we find Ruby's mother? 
RUBY: Yeah, and what happens if we do? 
DOCTOR: One question at a time. Okay... All right, the Tardis doesn't have much power, but if it can just make one final... 
(A roundal bursts open and drops a load of whistles.) 
DOCTOR: Whoa! Oh, handy. Love a whistle. 2046, here we come! 
RUBY: But 2046 doesn't exist, does it? 
DOCTOR: Yes, but it is preserved in death 'cos I once landed there. So it's fixed, yeah? Hold that down. 
SUTEKH [OC]: I see them, Melanie. Every living thing contains dead cells. Skin. Nails. Enamel.

[UNIT HQ]

SUSAN: Sutekh can see through the dead.

[Memory Tardis]

SUTEKH [OC]: Melanie. 
SUSAN [OC]: Closer. Closer! Bring them to Sutekh. Find the mother's name!

[Cardiff City Hall]

(According to the sign indicating the Ferrier Hall and function rooms... The Tardis has parked symmetrically within the space. There are piles of dust around.) 
DOCTOR: 2046. (to Tardis) Thank you. 
(They walk along a corridor.) 
DOCTOR: I was in this building for the overthrow of Roger ap Gwilliam. It was the Department of Health. It'll have the DNA. 
(Sonicks open a door.) 
RUBY: So we're, like, hacking a computer? 
DOCTOR: Sort of thing, yeah.

[Minister's office]

(Desks, books, sofas with piles of dust... He swaps the clear computer screen for the TV monitor and it powers up.) 
DOCTOR: Nice. Okay, the DNA list was locked away under top security. But guess who invented the security? (points sonic) Come on. Come on, come on, 
come on, come on. Please, come on, come on. Yes! Yes! Okay, Mel, you'd better keep watch. Sutekh's servants could be anywhere. And don't take any risks. 
We're all getting out of this. 
MEL: Don't worry about me. Find that name. 
(She goes into the corridor and shuts the door.) 
SUTEKH [OC]: Submit to me, Melanie. 
(The Doctor pricks Ruby's finger and the sonic analyses her blood then calls up the record relating to it.) 
RUBY: That's me. So what do we do now? 
DOCTOR: Press search. Somewhere in there is your mother's name, and maybe we can use it to fight Sutekh. It's searching 76 million people. 
RUBY: Who is she? 
SUTEKH [OC]: Melanie. Melanie. Melanie. I see you. 
(Shepherd's Bell Carol arranged by Samuel Pegg plays.) 
SUTEKH [OC]: Submit to the will of Sutekh. 
(It is snowing in the room and the corridor. Something jolts the Doctor and Ruby off their feet.) 
DOCTOR: Keep looking! 
(DNA match confirmed.) 
RUBY: But... what does it mean? 
(Ruby turns to see Mel's hand reaching for the Doctor.) 
DOCTOR: She died. She died, Ruby. I'm sorry. I loved you, Mel. 
SUTEKH-MEL: And what good did love do, Doctor? When did it ever help? Now, give me the name. 
RUBY: But what does it mean? 
SUTEKH-MEL: Give... Sutekh... the name. 
SUTEKH [OC]: Bring me the Time Lord and the Child and their precious secret. 
(Harriet activates the Tardis.)

[UNIT HQ]

(Ruby, the Doctor, and Mel in a black robe materialise.) 
SUTEKH-MEL: I bring you a gift, Holy Sutekh. 
SUTEKH: Excellent. 
SUTEKH-MEL: The last two creatures in existence, to die at your hand.  
SUTEKH-SUSAN + MEL: Then you can end our wretched half-life, so that silence can reign and you can stand alone for all eternity, 
gazing upon your empire of dust and ice and oblivion. 
SUTEKH: Show me the name. Show me, Child. 
DOCTOR: Sutekh... 
SUTEKH: Bring the name to me. 
DOCTOR: Sutekh, I promise you, I will worship you, if you just allow me... Argh! 
SUTEKH: Desist. You have lived for far too long, little Lord of Time. 
RUBY: I've got the name! 
DOCTOR: No! 
RUBY: I've got the name, and I'll give it to you. Can you just let him go? 
DOCTOR: Don't. Don't. 
RUBY: The screen, it found the name, but I don't understand, and I wish I could. It's the only thing... that I've ever wanted for all these years. 
But now I've found it... and I don't understand. But maybe you can. Maybe this... is for you. 
(Ruby holds the TV monitor out to Sutekh.) 
SUTEKH: Waited for so long... 
(Then drops it, smashing it to pieces.) 
RUBY: You great big god of nothing! 
SUTEKH: No! 
(Ruby fastens one end of a very long bungee cord to Sutekh's collar and gives the other end to the Doctor, who clips it to his belt.) 
DOCTOR: Cos I knew, Sutekh! I knew! 
DOCTOR [memory]: She's too cold. Listen to me. 
DOCTOR: This way. 
(Blows the whistle.)  
SUTEKH: Die at the hand of Sutekh! 
(Mel and Susan advance. The Doctor blows the whistle again. Harriet stares as the real Tardis operates herself, 
powering up a propulsion beam from under the console to blast Harriet and send herself flying across the floor, out from under Sutekh.) 

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: I'm back! 
(He clips his end of the cord to the underside of the console and removes an Intelligent glove. Ruby takes hers off too.) 
DOCTOR: Into the Vortex. 
(The Doctor and Sutekh dematerialise. The Tardis drags Sutekh through the Vortex behind her.) 
DOCTOR: Okay, hold that lever down. 
RUBY: What just happened? 
DOCTOR: Love my whistle! 
RUBY: Got it! 
(The Doctor shouts from the open doors.) 
DOCTOR: You saw all of Time and Space with me, Sutekh! So I thought, what if you see it again? What happens if you bring death to death? You bring life! 
(Sutekh's claw rips through grey skies to reveal blue. Everyone on Earth returns to life.)

[Ruby's home]
 
FLOOD: Oh, that clever boy! That clever boy! 
(On the helipad, Kate takes Colonel Ibrahim's hand and smiles up at him.)

[Tardis]

DOCTOR: Bring death to death! Everywhere! Leave that. Hold that and that. 
RUBY: What's happening? 
DOCTOR: Life, Ruby. Life! 
RUBY: Ah! 
DOCTOR: We bring life to the whole flippin' universe! 
RUBY: Ha, ha! 
DOCTOR: Vortis. Tigella. Vox. Messaline. Calufrax. Spiridon. Telos. Shan Shen. Ah! The Ood Sphere is alive! Ha! Oh! Welcome back, the Ood! 
And there! There. The planet is called Agua Santina. 
(Where the kind woman plays with her baby amid lush vegetation.) 
WOMAN: Hey! 
DOCTOR: With a spoon. We fought a monster. And now... I must become a monster. 
(He goes to the door again.) 
DOCTOR: Sutekh the Destroyer! The Lord God of Death itself! You win! Because I pride myself... I pride myself that I am better than you. 
Because if you're death... then I must represent life. Surely, that's what I am. Life! And that's how you win, Sutekh. Because you've turned me into this. 
I am the one that brings death. 
SUTEKH: No! 
(Sutekh has nearly reached the doors when the Doctor closes them, cutting the bungee cord.) 
SUTEKH: No! 
(Sutekh dissolves.)

[UNIT HQ]

(Saluting Ibrahim.) 
SOLDIER: Sir. 
SUSAN: But I'm still me. I've still got my memories, my family. All of that's still true, is it? 
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You are who you are. 
MEL: The God of Death created life. 
KATE: And he gave you a very good brain. I think UNIT can use you. 
DOCTOR: Oh. 
SUSAN: Oh, pet. Anything to help. I don't mind. I'll make the tea. 
IBRAHIM: Did you make this tea? 
SUSAN: I did, yes. 
IBRAHIM: Don't make the tea. 
ROSE: Ooo! Christofer! 
CARLA: You should've seen me. I had to walk home. I got in, and your gran was telling me off for not dusting. 
DOCTOR: Cherry. 
CARLA: But I wanted to say... 
RUBY: Oh, don't, Mum. It's all right. 
CARLA: I wanted to say thank you, Doctor. You brought her home. 
KATE: You brought all of us back from, well, who knows where. 
RUBY: Do you remember what happened when you...? 
KATE: Echoes. 
DOCTOR: Mmm. 
(Bing, bong.) 
MORRIS: We've done it. 
VLINX: DNA retrieval 100%. 
DOCTOR: Wow! 
RUBY: My mother. 
MORRIS: Louise Alison Miller. 35 years old. 15 when she gave birth to you. 
(Looking very like Lucie Miller, but alas not.) 
KATE: Records say her stepfather was... Well, he was trouble. I think she did the right thing getting you out of that house. 
ROSE: She must've hidden the pregnancy. 
KATE: Father, William Benjamin Garnet. 15 at the time. Louise moved to Coventry at the age of 18. Did well, got a degree. She's a nurse. 
RUBY: That's what I don't understand. She... she's so ordinary. 
DOCTOR: She's wonderful. 
RUBY: No, she's wonderful and she's ordinary, but I love her for that. I just... How did she stay invisible from a god? She defeated Sutekh. 
DOCTOR: She was important... because we think she's important. That's how everything happens, every war, every religion, every love story. 
We invest things with significance. So while the whole of creation was turning around her, it made her sheer existence more powerful 
than Time Lords and gods. In the end, the most important person in the universe... was the most ordinary. A scared little girl... making her baby safe. 
ROSE: But she pointed. 
MEL: She did! She pointed at you, Doctor. 
DOCTOR: She wasn't pointing at me. 'Cos we cleaned up the VHS. Behind me was that lamppost. 
RUBY: So? 
DOCTOR: It was a signpost. She was pointing at the name of the road. She was naming you. 
RUBY: God... I always thought I was called Ruby because the social workers chose it, or the paramedics, or whatever, but, no, it was... her. 
My own mother chose it. My name is Ruby.

[Outside a coffee shop]

DOCTOR: She's happy. She's got a flat. She's got a fella named Mike. She goes to Spain in three weeks. And the point is is that she has had over 
7,000 days to come and find you, and she never has. 
RUBY: But I've found her. 
DOCTOR: With a time machine. Is that fair? Louise Miller made her choices, and... I think we should leave that alone.

[Coffee shop]

BARISTA: What can I get you? 
RUBY: Oat cappuccino, please. 
(She sits nearly opposite Louise.) 
BARISTA: Ruby? 
RUBY: That's me. I was named after a road. Ruby Road. You left me by a church... 19 years ago. 
LOUISE: Oh, my God. 
RUBY: You left me where I was safe. And I just want to say thank you. 
LOUISE: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
RUBY: No, no, it's okay. 
LOUISE: Oh, it's you! Oh, it's... 
(Big hug with tears.) 
LOUISE: My baby.

[Ruby's home]

CHERRY: Ooo, that's nice! 
LOUISE: I always thought I should get in touch. Every Christmas I thought, right, this is the year. But every Christmas, I thought, what if she hates me? 
CHERRY: There is no hatred in this house, darling. 
CARLA: But what we have got is photos. 
LOUISE: Yeah? 
CARLA: I've got about 500! Proper photos. I printed them off. You wait till you see her at ten years old. She dressed up as David Bowie.

[Tardis]

RUBY: Won't be long. We're just going to have a catch-up and a pizza, and Mum's set up a bed in Gran's room so Louise can stay the night. 
And then we can head off, you and me. 
DOCTOR: Where to? 
RUBY: Wherever you want. 
DOCTOR: Ruby... 
RUBY: Come out and join. I've told her so much about you. She knows everything, and... 
(Ruby's phone rings, because she always has it in her hand even at home.) 
RUBY: Hold on, sorry. Leave that. And, no, I said, life with the Doctor is just mad, and... Hang on, I'd better... Oh, my God. They think they've found him. 
My dad, William. They think... Because it turns out his mum and dad still live at the same address, but she never told him, my mum, my real mum, 
so she never told Will about me, so he doesn't even know I exist, so we've got to go and... I'm sorry. 
DOCTOR: Don't be sorry. Don't be sorry at all. Your life... is out there now. I've shown you monsters and planets, and legends... but this... 
Honey, your adventure is just beginning. 
RUBY: But you could come and see my dad. You don't do that, do you? Will I ever see you again? 
DOCTOR: Of course you will. Of course you will. 
RUBY: Your own granddaughter. You left her and never went back. 
DOCTOR: And that was my mistake. Maybe I'll find her again, one day. But you, Ruby Sunday, I will see again. Because you changed me. 
I talk about family in a way that I never did before. That's because of you. You have made my life bigger and better. 
And now, Ruby Sunday... goodbye. 
RUBY: I love you. 
(They all watch the Tardis dematerialise.)

[Rooftop]

(In a white hooded coat and a white parasol and briefcase... a touch of Mary Poppins.) 
FLOOD: And that's how the story of the Church on Ruby Road comes to an end, with a very happy ending for little Ruby Sunday.
But life goes on, doesn't it? Ruthlessly. And what happens, you might wonder. Oh, what happens to that mysterious traveller in Time and Space 
known as the Doctor? I'm sorry to say his story ends in absolute terror. Night, night.
